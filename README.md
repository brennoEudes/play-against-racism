## The Project 
This is a web-responsive project developed for the Rocket Seat Technology School. The demand was to develop the light/dark mode for a web application, exploring the JavaScript methods to display and to hidden elements.

## Inspiration
The feature of light/dark mode or black/white colors inspired me to think about the racism issue, especially after Real Madrid's Brazilian football player, Vinícius Júnior, has been suffered racism in a game at Spanish National Championship.

## Idea & Artificial Inteligence
The idea was to create a hypothetical social-educational campaign against racism, promoted by Vinicius Júnior Institute. 

The images of Martin Luther King and Vinicius Júnior were generated by artificial intelligence.

The piece displays a button to the historian Ibram X. Kendi's TED presentation, in which the author of the book "How to be antiracist" explains the difference between being "not racist" and antiracist. 

## Technologies
The technologies used were:
- HTML;
- CSS;
- JavaScript;
- Figma;
- Git and GitHub.
